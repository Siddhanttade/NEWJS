# javascript and classes
## Does javascript have classes
## yes it does have classes but it is a prototype based language primarily and other things are syntactical sugar

## OOP=>Programming paradigm(Style of programming)

# Object
- collection of properties and methods
- toLowerCase

## Why use oop
-code used to mess up(spagetti code) no chunk could be reused due to oop it became easy to use components like services

## parts of oop
Object Literal
-Constructor
-Proto
-classes
-instances(new,this)

Abstraction: Abstraction is the concept of hiding the complex implementation details and showing only the essential features of the object. It helps in reducing programming complexity and increases efficiency.

Example: Consider a Car class. You don’t need to know how the engine works to drive a car; you just need to know how to use the steering wheel, pedals, and gears.

Encapsulaton: Encapsulation is the bundling of data and methods that operate on that data within one unit, often a class. It restricts direct access to some of the object’s components, which can help prevent accidental modification.

Example: In a BankAccount class, the balance is encapsulated, and you can only modify it through methods like deposit or withdraw.

Inheritance: Inheritance allows a class to inherit properties and methods from another class. This promotes code reusability and establishes a relationship between classes.

Example: A Vehicle class can be a base class, and Car and Bike can inherit from it. 

Polymorphism: Polymorphism allows methods to do different things based on the object it is acting upon, even if they share the same name. This can be achieved through method overriding and method overloading.

Example: Consider the start_engine method in both Car and Bike classes, which behaves differently based on the object type.
